            <h1>How Do You Build a PC?</h1>
            <h3>Components</h2>
             <p>
                We will be talking about how to build a PC including the parts you will need
                <br> and links to a few guides. We recommend that when making a list of components
                <br> that you go to or the <a href='https://pcpartpicker.com/', target='_blank'>PcPartPicker </a> as it will tell you whether the parts
                <br> you have chosen are compatible with eachother as well as display the best prices
                <br> for the components that you have chosen to use.
            </p>

            <h3>Motherbaord</h3>
            <p>
                The motherboard is the circuit board where everything comes together.
                <br>Once everything comes together it is a completely functional computer.
                <br>It comes in many sizes which most commonly are: ATX,microAtx, or ITX.
                <br> Depending if you go with Intel or AMD you will have to get the specific model that supports their CPUs
                <br> Motherboards usually come in different tiers and bring different features. For Example,
                <br> X570 and B550 motherboards have Pcie Gen 4 support meanwhile all boards that support intel don't.
                <br>Also if you are planning to overclock you may want to look into a motherboard with a great VRM Setup.
            </p>

            <h3>CPU</h3>
            <p>
                The CPU is the brain of your computer and also the most important.
                <br>This is one of the expensive parts but depending on what you're planning to 
                <br> with the computer you are building it might not be the most expensive.
                <br> do with this part your two options are Intel CPUs or AMD CPUs. The Advantage with Intel
                <br> is their Single core performance and higher clock speeds so if you are focused more
                <br> on playing games then Intel is way to go. If you are rendering videos or are using tasks that
                <br> require many threads like Live streaming while gaming then AMD is the way to go as their CPUs
                <br> have all around great performance and more cores.
            </p>

            <h3>CPU Cooler</h3>
            <p>
                The CPU coolers are responsible for keeping you CPU cool or at moderate temperatures.
                <br> If you are planning to overclock then you may want to look into making a custom water loop
                <br> or an AIO cooler. Of course you can also use something like the <a href='https://noctua.at/en/nh-u12s', target='_blank'>Noctua NH-U12s </a> or the <a href='https://noctua.at/en/nh-u12s', target='_blank'>Noctua D15 </a>.
                <br>Ig you aren't planning on overclocking then you will be fine with the stock cooler that comes with your
                <br>Ryzen CPU but if you got Intel then the <a href='https://noctua.at/en/nh-u12s', target='_blank'>Hyper 212 EVO</a> by cooler master is recommended
            </p>

            <h3>Graphics Card</h3>
            <p>
                The Graphics Card is the most important component depending on your usage.
                <br> If you are planning to play games, edit videos, or doing other graphical intensive
                <br> tasks then you will need to buy one according to what you need. At the moment NVIDIA
                <br> is leading in terms of the high end graphics card with their <a href='https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/rtx-2080-ti/', target='_blank'>RTX 2080 TI</a> graphics card.
                <br> For the mid-range you might want to look into AMD's <a href='https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-5700-xt', target='_blank'>Radeon RX 5700 XT</a> graphics card.
                <br> For anybody on more of a budget then they should consider one of many NVIDIA's budget options
                <br> Like the GTX 1060 Super or the GTX 1050 Ti
            </p>

            <h3>Ram</h3>
            <p>
                RAM is very important as it stores cache for programs to call in a very short amount of time.
                <br> If you are planning to game, livestream, or edit videos then you should look into getting a 16GB RAM Kit.
                <br> If you are planning on just using the computer for web surfing then 8GB is recommended.
                <br> On Intel's side we do recommend we recommend the Corsair's <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Vengeance-3000MHz-Desktop-Memory/dp/B0134EW7G8?tag=wpcentralb-20&ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU73793YYwYg', target='_blank'>Vengeance LPX</a> 16 GB kit
                <br> and on AMD's side we recommend GSKill's <a href='https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-16gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820232809?nm_mc=AFC-RAN-COM&cm_mmc=AFC-RAN-COM&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_source=afc-CGDirector&AFFID=3650046&AFFNAME=CGDirector&ACRID=1&ASUBID=&ASID=&ranMID=44583&ranEAID=3650046&ranSiteID=dJwWA6es.YE-uEf6viJds5O0wV69L.It3Q', target='_blank'>Trident Z Royal</a> 16 GB kit.
            </p>

            <h3>Power Supply</h3>
            <p>
                The Power Supply you need is very dependant on your components and their power consumption.
                <br> On this part you shouldn't cheap out on because this one could potentially break a component
                <br> if it isn't certified. For this one we do recommend EVGA's <a href='https://www.newegg.com/evga-supernova-750-ga-220-ga-0750-x1-750w/p/1HU-00J7-004V2?&quicklink=true', target='_blank'>750W 80 PLUS GOLD Modular</a> Power Supply
            </p>
            <img src="Images/PSU.png" height=500, width=800, alt="Picture of Power Supply">
            <h3>Storage</h3>
            <p>
                For the storage we recommend you go with something faster like an SSD then later down
                <br> the road you get a high capacity hdd with it to store other less important files.
                <br> The SSD will make it so that the PC boots into the OS faster than something like a hdd.
                <br> For this we recommend Samsung's <a href='https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/solid-state-drives/ssd-970-evo-plus-nvme-m-2-500gb-mz-v7s500b-am/', target='_blank'>500GB 970 EVO PLus </a> m.2 drive and
                <br> with that you can get a hhd, specifically Seagate's <a href='https://www.shorturl.at/qCOQR', target='_blank'>BarraCuda 2TB 7200 RPM </a> hard drive
            </p>
            <img src="Images/ssd.png" height=500, width=800, alt="Picture of SSD">
            <h3>Case</h3>
            <p>
                For this case we can't recommend anything as it's the most customaizable part
                <br> There are so many options in the market but one thing to be aware of is to make sure 
                <br> that the case you are buying is compatible with your Motherboard and check if the case
                <br> has the kind of performance you are looking for as it is closed afterall.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/case.png" height=600, width=600, alt="Picture of Case">
            <h3>OS</h3>
            <p>
                For OS there are really only three options: Windows, MacOS, or Linux
                <br> Linux is open source and many prefer it for many reasons such as concern for privacy. 
                <br>Windows 10 is also another very popular option as it is very user friendly the only concern
                <br> being is that you are more vulnerable to Viruses as there is a larger install base and that
                <br>Microsoft may collect your data. As for MacOS it is a bit more complicated to install into a PC
                <br> that you built but it is possible with Virtualization. 
            </p>

            <h3>Putting it together</h3>
            <p>
                Congratulations! You have now successfuly gotten all your parts. We recommend
                Looking at the many guides linked below to build your very own PC.
